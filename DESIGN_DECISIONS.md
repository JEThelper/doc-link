# DESIGN_DECISIONS.md

Companion to `DECISIONS.md`, logging UI/UX design-track choices per the design
spec §6. Functional/architecture decisions live in `DECISIONS.md`.

## Typeface & sourcing
- **Sans (UI + editor):** Inter (variable), self-hosted via `@fontsource-variable/inter`.
- **Mono (slug/URL, code, `/raw`):** JetBrains Mono, self-hosted via `@fontsource/jetbrains-mono`.
- Both are bundled by Vite from npm — **no external/unapproved CDN**, satisfying the
  spec's "self-hosted or approved CDN" requirement.

## Theme
- Light + dark both implemented as CSS custom properties in `src/styles/tokens.css`.
- First visit respects `prefers-color-scheme`; manual toggle persists to
  `localStorage` (`spacepad-theme`). Account-level persistence lands with auth (Phase 4).
- Neither bg is pure white/black per spec (light `#fafafa`, dark `#16161c`).

## Presence color palette (final)
Separate from the brand palette. 10 evenly-spaced hues, **red and amber deliberately
excluded** so presence never reads as danger/warning. Defined in `src/styles/presence.ts`,
assigned round-robin per session:
`indigo, sky, teal, emerald, lime, violet, fuchsia, pink, cyan, blue`.
Selections render at ~18% opacity of the peer's solid color. (Live wiring: Phase 2.)

## Dashboard layout choice (Phase 5 — final)
- **Google Keep-style card grid** (supersedes previous table decision)
- Context: As part of the 2026-06-28 River visual overhaul we replaced the
  information-dense table with a masonry/grid of raised note-like cards to
  improve scanability, rhythm, and surface hierarchy. This change is purely
  visual — all inline controls (rename, visibility, archive, delete) remain
  accessible and keyboard/touch friendly.
- Implementation: `.dash-grid` / `.dash-card` styles in `src/index.css`, and
  `AccountPads.tsx` now renders cards instead of table rows.
- **Name vs slug display rule** (spec §2): a renamed pad shows its custom name with the
  `/slug` trailing in muted mono; a never-renamed pad shows the slug itself in mono. So a
  pad always has a stable, scannable identity whether or not it's been named.
- **Last-edited** uses relative time (`Intl.RelativeTimeFormat`) with the full timestamp on
  `title` hover (`format.ts`).

## Continuous homepage → pad transition
- The homepage central element is a borderless auto-growing `<textarea>` that *is* the
  create action (click or first keystroke). Typed/seeded text is carried into the new
  pad via router state (`{ seed }`) and saved immediately, so the empty→full transition
  is client-routed with no full reload and no loading spinner (spec §0 tertiary, §2.1, §5).
- True single-DOM-element morph (literally reusing the same node restyled across the
  route change) is approximated rather than pixel-perfect: the homepage and editor are
  separate routes sharing identical typography/caret tokens, so the visual handoff is
  continuous. Logged as a conscious approximation, not a violation.

## Components built once, reused (spec §6)
`CopyButton`, `TopBar`, `PresenceStack`, `ConnectionIndicator`, `ThemeToggle` live in
`src/components/`.

## File chip + upload (Phase 3)
- `FileTray` (`src/components/FileTray.tsx`) sits below the editor: a click/drag-drop
  dropzone plus a row of file chips. No modal — uploads are inline and ambient, per the
  anti-pattern rules.
- **Chips encode scan state** rather than hiding unscanned files: `clean` chips are a
  monospace download link with size; `pending` shows "scanning…" (warning color);
  `failed` shows the name struck-through with "unavailable" (danger color) and a tooltip
  explaining it failed the malware scan. This keeps the security state visible instead of
  silently dropping files.
- Styling uses existing tokens (pill radius, surface/border, mono for filenames) so the
  tray reads as part of the same system.

## Auth screens + signed-in TopBar (Phase 4)
- `/login` and `/signup` share one `AuthPage` component (a single card, no modal) with
  email/password fields and a "Continue with Google" button. Minimal and token-styled,
  consistent with the no-onboarding/no-mascot rules.
- The TopBar now reflects session state: when signed out it keeps the dismissible
  "Sign in to keep this pad forever" hint; when signed in it shows the display name (or
  email) + a "Log out" action and hides the hint.
- **Claim affordance**: a logged-in user viewing an unowned pad sees a "Claim this pad"
  pill in the TopBar. It disappears once the pad has an owner. This surfaces the new
  ownership capability inline rather than via a separate management screen (that's
  Phase 5).

## Editor surface (Phase 2)
- The Phase 1 `<textarea>` is replaced by **CodeMirror 6** (`src/components/CollabEditor.tsx`)
  bound to a Yjs doc via `y-codemirror.next` + `y-websocket`. CodeMirror was chosen over
  keeping the textarea because in-text remote cursors/selections (design spec §2.2) are
  not renderable in a plain textarea. The editor theme (`collabTheme.ts`) maps CM6 onto
  the existing design tokens so the homepage→pad typography handoff stays continuous.
- **Remote cursors/selections** render via `yCollab` using the presence palette
  (`presence.ts`). Peer color is assigned per browser session (stable across reloads via
  `sessionStorage`) and shared through Yjs awareness.
- **`PresenceStack` and `ConnectionIndicator` are now live**: peers come from awareness
  state; the connection indicator reflects the real `WebsocketProvider` status
  (`connected` → silent, `disconnected` → "Reconnecting…", re-`connected` → "Reconnected").
- The per-keystroke REST save + "Saving…/Saved" indicator is removed; persistence is now
  the server-side debounced CRDT flush, so the indicator would be redundant.

## Dashboard inline controls (Phase 5)
- **No modals — all inline**, keeping the "Anti-patterns" record below intact.
  - **Rename** (§4.4): the name cell becomes an input in place; Enter/blur commits, Escape
    reverts.
  - **Visibility** (§4.3): the visibility cell is a button (current state + glyph) that
    opens a small inline `role=menu` of the three options directly under it — not a modal,
    not a separate page.
  - **Archive / delete** (§4.5): delete swaps the row's action cluster for an inline
    "Delete? Yes / No" confirmation; archive/unarchive is a single inline action that drops
    the row from the current view. Edits apply optimistically for immediacy.
- **Hover-revealed actions with a keyboard/touch equivalent.** Row actions are real
  `<button>`s always present in the DOM, revealed on `:hover`/`:focus-within` and shown
  unconditionally on touch (`@media (hover: none)`) — the tap-and-hold/kebab fallback the
  spec §2 calls for, and a precondition for the accessibility pass.

## Signed-in TopBar — "My Pads" (Phase 5)
- The signed-in TopBar (from Phase 4) gains a **"My Pads"** link to `/account/pads`,
  sitting alongside the display name + "Log out". The signed-out hint and Claim affordance
  are unchanged — this extends the Phase 4 state rather than replacing it.

## Read-only & no-access surfaces (Phase 5)
- A pad the viewer may read but not edit renders as a **static read-only surface** (escaped
  text, no editor chrome) instead of the live collaborative editor — viewers don't open the
  write socket at all.
- **`ConnectionIndicator` gains a distinct `noaccess` state.** A permission rejection (WS
  close 4403) must not look like a network drop: it reads "View-only — no edit access" in
  the warning color, never the pulsing "Reconnecting…". A pad the user can't read at all
  (REST 403) gets its own full state screen ("This pad is private").

## Account recovery screens (Phase 7)
- `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`, `/verify-email` reuse the single `auth-card`
  pattern (no modal, token-styled), consistent with the Phase 4 auth screens. The reset
  request screen always shows the same "if an account exists…" confirmation — the UI mirrors
  the backend's no-existence-oracle stance.

## PIN-protected pads (Supabase + PIN phase)
- **Locked-pad screen, not a modal or wall.** When `GET /api/pads/{slug}` returns
  `locked: true`, the pad route renders a calm on-brand screen reusing the `auth-card`
  pattern (`Pad.tsx` `LockedPad`): a short "This pad is locked" line, the `/slug` in muted
  mono, and a single PIN field + submit. It reads as part of the editor chrome, not a
  jarring interruption — consistent with the no-modal anti-pattern record below.
- **Input adapts to `pin_format`.** A numeric PIN uses `inputMode="numeric"` +
  `pattern="[0-9]*"` (keypad on mobile); an alphanumeric passcode uses a plain text input.
  The field is `type="password"` either way so a shoulder-surfer can't read it.
- **Two distinct inline error states (not one, not a toast).** A wrong PIN shows the
  backend's inline "Incorrect PIN" message (`role="alert"`), matching the auth-page
  validation pattern. A rate-limited 429 shows a *different* message — "Too many attempts,
  try again in about N minute(s)" derived from `Retry-After` — and disables the input until
  then, so a lockout never masquerades as a typo.
- **No persistent "unlocked" banner.** Once unlocked, the pad behaves like any accessible
  pad for the window; the existing connection/access-state indicators carry the state. We
  deliberately did not add an always-on "you are unlocked" element for a background concern.
- **Dashboard PIN toggle, orthogonal to visibility.** In `AccountPads.tsx` the inline
  controls gain a PIN affordance (add / set format numeric|alphanumeric / remove) alongside
  the visibility control. It is **hidden when `private` is selected**, mirroring the
  server-side mutual-exclusion rule (`private` is a stronger gate) so the UI can't offer an
  invalid combined state.

## Anti-patterns (spec §5)
- Still none violated. No spinners on the homepage→pad transition, no modals (dashboard
  inline controls included), no toasts, no onboarding, no mascot. Connection status, copy
  confirmation, and all dashboard edits are ambient/inline.

## Phase-8 – Frontend feature additions

### 6.1 Locked-pad screen – visual rework
- **Background animation** – chose an SVG “wavy line” field with `stroke-dasharray` animation (non‑WebGL, respects `prefers-reduced-motion`).
- **Auto-submit on PIN length** – numeric PINs auto-submit when they reach 4‑6 digits; the `Enter` key still provides explicit submit for alphanumeric PINs.
- **Inline visual error** – the input shakes + turns danger colour; the message appears below without a modal or toast.

### 6.2 Five-theme system
- Implemented five named themes (`oxidized-copper`, `walnut-ink`, `storm-slate`, `white`, `black`) as CSS custom property suffixes (`[data-theme="oxidized-copper"]`, etc.).
- Each theme has its own light/dark variant set in `tokens.css`.
- **Homepage auto‑rotation** – time‑of‑day bands map to themes. Location (timezone) serves as a tie‑breaker.
- **Manual pick overrides** – stored in `localStorage` under `spacepad-theme`; persists across visits.

### 6.3 Hidden formatting panel in editor
- **Reveal mechanism** – `Ctrl+Shift+F` keyboard shortcut. The panel never appears on hover or click to prevent accidental activation.
- **Persistence scope** – per‑pad stored values in `localStorage` (`collabFormatting` JSON) so formatting choices travel with the browser session.
- **Decision** – picked per‑pad persistence because it avoids extra back‑end writes and keeps the UX lightweight. Flagged in `DECISIONS.md`.

### 6.4 Constrained editor page width
- Added a `<select>` in the top‑bar (`Width` control) for **Narrow / Standard / Wide**.
- Presets applied via CSS variable `--canvas-max-width` (Narrow = 600 px, Standard = 740 px, Wide = 1024 px).
- Preference persisted in `localStorage` under `spacepad-editor-width`.

### 6.5 Side display for uploaded media
- Implemented a right‑hand side panel (`.pad-file-side`) that houses the existing `FileTray`.
- Responsive fallback: on viewports `< 768 px` the side panel collapses to `width: 100 %` and stacks under the editor.
- No new back‑end endpoints required – `FileTray` already lists/removes files via existing API.

### 6.6 `/new` anonymous pad creation route
- Routes to a lightweight component (`NewPad.tsx`) that runs `createPad()` and redirects to the new slug.
- Mirrors the homepage’s “instant‑create” flow without extra intermediate screen.

### 6.7 Copy button – full URL
- Changed the `CopyButton` value from just `slug` to `${origin}/${slug}` to copy the shareable full URL.
- No back‑end changes; purely client-side.

## Trade-offs documented

- **Auto-rotating homepage theme** – means the landing page does not have a single canonical appearance. Documented as an intentional trade‑off.
- **Per-pad formatting persistence** – stored locally; no account-level preference introduced to keep Phase-8 scope minimal.
- **Side panel collapse on mobile** – chosen over a persistent off-canvas drawer for simplicity and accessibility (keyboard focus still reaches actions).
This pass restyles the surfaces that exist in Phase 1 (homepage + pad editor + state
screens) to the design system. The editor is still a plain `<textarea>`; the
WYSIWYG-markdown Tiptap surface, remote cursors, presence, drag-drop upload UI, login/
signup, and dashboard are built in their respective PRD phases on top of these tokens
and components.

## URL scheme & usernames
- **Usernames in top-level namespace:** Usernames are case-insensitive (stored normalized)
  but displayed as entered. They occupy the same top-level URL space as pads and reserved
  routes, sharing the reserved-word list to prevent routing conflicts (e.g. a username of
  `new` would be ambiguous with the creation route).
- **Three address formats coexist:**
  - `/{slug}` for anonymous pads (existing, unchanged behavior).
  - `/{username}/{padname}` for owned pads, where padname is the slug or custom name.
  - `/new` (global), `/{username}/new`, `/{username}/new/{custom-name}` for creation.
    The `/new` catch-all is routed at the frontend (any URL ending in `/new` is treated
    as a creation request); the backend does not special-case it.
- **Claiming and renaming redirect:** When an anonymous pad is claimed (gains an owner),
  accessing the old `/{slug}` returns a 301 redirect to `/{username}/{slug}`. Similarly,
  when an owned pad is renamed, the old `/{username}/{old-name}` address redirects to the
  new one. This preserves existing links and bookmarks across ownership and name changes.
- **Rename changes the address (design pivot):** The original Phase-5 dashboard spec treated
  custom names as display-only, not affecting the underlying pad address. The new URL scheme
  makes custom names **the actual address**, so renaming now changes the pad's URL. This is
  intentional, and redirects ensure old links don't break. Documented as a deliberate
  decision change in `DECISIONS.md`.

## 2026-06-28 — Canonicalization moves client-side (supersedes the 301-redirect note above)
- **The REST API no longer 301-redirects owned pads.** The "Claiming and renaming redirect"
  note above (server-issued 301 from `/{slug}` → `/{username}/{padname}`) is reversed at the
  API layer because it broke programmatic fetches and the path-scoped PIN unlock cookie (see
  `AUDIT.md` B4 and the matching dated entry in `DECISIONS.md`).
- **New UX contract:** fetching a pad returns `200` with a `canonical_url` field in the body
  (`/{username}/{padname}`, or the *current* name when the pad was opened via an old name).
  The SPA is responsible for canonicalizing the **address bar** — e.g. `history.replaceState`
  to `canonical_url` after load — instead of relying on an HTTP redirect. User-visible outcome
  is the same (old links still resolve and the bar shows the canonical address), but content
  never round-trips through a redirect, so PIN-unlocked and owner views load correctly.

## 2026-06-29 — Mobile & small-screen optimization pass (audit + fixes)

An audit-and-fix pass making every surface hold up at real phone widths
(360–430px) and small-tablet widths (600–768px), portrait and landscape, without
re-deciding the underlying designs. All changes are additive (gated on width/
pointer media queries) so the desktop experience is unchanged. Verification
method and its limits are recorded in `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` (no real-device
or axe-core browser harness exists in this environment — those remain a QA step).

### Cross-cutting design choices
- **Touch targets → ≥44×44px on touch only.** Every tappable control is bumped to
  the 44px floor under `@media (pointer: coarse)` (not by width), so mouse users
  keep the compact desktop sizing while every touch device — phone *or* tablet —
  gets accessible targets. Covers buttons, the copy/slug control, theme toggle
  (made a full 44×44 square), the hint-dismiss ✕, file-chip remove ✕, the file
  dropzone, dashboard action/tab/visibility controls, and chrome text links
  (My Pads / Log out / state-screen links). Icon-only controls get `min-width`
  too, not just height.
- **No iOS focus-zoom.** All text inputs/selects/textarea are forced to ≥16px on
  coarse pointers (the threshold below which iOS Safari zooms on focus). The
  editor (17px), auth fields (17px), search (17px), and PIN field (22px) were
  already compliant; the width `<select>` and the (currently unrendered) dashboard
  rename/PIN fields are now explicitly raised so a touch *tablet* above the phone
  breakpoint can't trigger zoom either.
- **No sideways scroll, ever.** Belt-and-braces `overflow-x: hidden` on `html,
  body`, plus the real fixes: the topbar columns can shrink (`min-width: 0`) and
  the slug label truncates with ellipsis instead of pushing the bar wide; the
  editor scroll area is `overflow-x: hidden`; remote-cursor name flags are
  width-capped; the hero headline steps down on the narrowest phones.
- **Safe-area insets** extended to the auth page, dashboard, and locked-pad
  overlay (the topbar/landing/footer/pad-layout already had them), so content and
  the theme toggle clear notches/home indicators in landscape.

### Per-screen
- **Pad editor topbar (the highest-risk screen).** The slug/copy control and the
  connection indicator are **never** hidden at any width (spec §2.2). To make room
  on phones: the width `<select>` is hidden (it's meaningless — the canvas fills
  the viewport regardless via `min(100%, --canvas-max-width)`), the user's display
  name is hidden (decorative; "My Pads" + "Log out" stay), and the brand wordmark
  is hidden only ≤380px. Presence still collapses to a `+N` count via the existing
  `PresenceStack` cap. The connection indicator drops its fixed-width reservation
  on phones and ellipsizes the rare long "View-only — no edit access" string.
- **Sign-in hint compaction (bug fix).** The previous rule hid the hint's *link
  text* on mobile but kept the dismiss ✕ — an orphaned button. Now the hint shows
  the full "Sign in to keep this pad forever" on desktop and a compact "Sign in"
  on phones (two spans, CSS-swapped), so the affordance survives intact.
- **Writing column on mobile.** Confirmed it expands to fill the narrow width
  (no fixed A4/Letter column is enforced on phones). Chrome padding around the
  canvas is reduced ≤640px so the text column is as wide as possible.
- **Locked-pad screen.** Title now reserves right padding so the corner theme
  toggle never overlaps it (was a latent overlap at all sizes, worse on a small
  card); overlay padding respects safe-area and shrinks ≤480px. The numeric-PIN
  keypad (`inputMode="numeric"`) and the 22px transparent PIN field were already
  correct and are retained.
- **Auth screens.** Added safe-area padding; fixed a double-card nesting bug in
  `ForgotPassword`/`ResetPassword` (a `<form class="auth-card">` inside a
  `<div class="auth-card">` doubled the border/padding and cramped narrow
  screens) by introducing a chrome-less `.auth-form` layout class. The Google +
  primary buttons meet the 44px touch floor.
- **Dashboard.** The card grid already collapses to a single column on phones and
  the row actions are already always-visible (no hover-to-reveal), so the touch
  fallback the spec §2 requires is present. Search goes full-width and the header
  controls wrap cleanly ≤640px.
- **Landing.** Hero headline steps to 26px ≤480px so the longest line fits at
  360px; the non-essential "How it works" anchor is dropped on the narrowest
  phones to keep "Sign in" + theme toggle tappable. `prefers-reduced-motion` is
  honoured globally (caret/connection animations) per the existing rule.
- **File upload on touch.** Drag-drop has no mobile equivalent; the dropzone
  already opens the native file/photo picker on tap (its `onClick`), and its label
  now reads "Tap to add files, or drop them here" so the touch path is obvious.

### Discrepancies found between documented designs and the shipped code (logged, not silently "fixed")
- **Hidden formatting panel is not in the build.** `CollabEditor` accepts
  `fontSize`/`fontColor` props but nothing renders a panel and no `Ctrl+Shift+F`
  handler exists — the Phase-8 "hidden formatting panel" is not wired up. There is
  therefore no hover/keyboard reveal needing a touch equivalent. Left as-is
  (re-adding the feature would be new scope, not a mobile fix).
- **The editor file panel is always stacked, not side-by-side.** `.pad-layout` is
  `flex-direction: column` at every width, so the file tray sits *below* the
  editor on desktop too — the documented desktop side-by-side + mobile-collapse
  behaviour isn't active. The always-stacked layout is already correct for mobile
  (full-width tray, no horizontal scroll), so this pass left it; re-introducing the
  desktop split is a desktop concern, out of scope here.
- **Homepage is a marketing page, not a "central typing element."** The current
  `Landing` is a hero/CTA marketing page, and the time-of-day theme rotation
  described in older notes was removed (single walnut palette + light/dark). §2.1's
  "large central typing element" and "color-rotation system" no longer match the
  code; the marketing landing was audited and fixed for mobile on its own terms.
- **Dashboard inline rename / visibility menu / PIN toggle / invite-by-email are
  not in the current `AccountPads`.** The shipped dashboard exposes Copy-link /
  Open / Archive only. The CSS for those controls still exists (and was made
  touch-safe defensively), but there was nothing rendered to fix.

## 2026-06-29 — Naming / claiming / redirect UI

UI for the rename/claim/redirect system (functional rationale in `DECISIONS.md`).

- **In-pad claim affordance generates a *token*, doesn't claim directly.** Per
  spec §3, claiming happens from the dashboard. The TopBar "Claim this pad" action
  now mints a token and reveals a calm banner under the top bar (`.claim-banner`)
  with the token, a copy button, and a link to the dashboard "Claim a pad" form —
  not a modal, consistent with the anti-pattern record. (Replaces the old
  direct-claim button, which would now fail since claim requires a token.)
- **Dashboard "Claim a pad" form** (`.dash-claim`): three inline fields — pad URL,
  claim token, and an always-shown PIN field ("if locked") — plus a Claim button.
  The SPA parses the slug from the pasted URL client-side (`parseSlug`) and calls
  the existing claim endpoint; the PIN is validated server-side. Inline success/
  error feedback (no toast). Inputs are ≥16px (no iOS zoom) and the row wraps on
  mobile.
- **Inline rename on dashboard cards** (the rename UI that the spec assumes but
  wasn't present): a "Rename" card action swaps the name into an in-place input
  (Enter commits, Escape cancels, blur commits), lower-cased as typed to match the
  slug rules; a 409 "name is taken" surfaces inline.
- **"Old links" (kill the trail)** is a per-card expandable list (`.dash-links`)
  showing each active redirect's old name with a "Kill" action — the granular
  privacy control from spec §5. Owner-only (the endpoints enforce it).
- **Address-bar canonicalization is now wired** (it was specced in B4 but the SPA
  wasn't doing it): on pad load, if `canonical_url` differs from the current path,
  `history.replaceState` updates the bar — so an old/slug URL still loads but the
  bar shows the canonical `/{username}/{name}` (or `/{name}` for a renamed
  anonymous pad), with no HTTP redirect.
