"""Cold-storage eligibility flagging. Phase 6.

Per PRD §5.4 this is a *storage-cost control*, not deletion and not a user-facing
"expiry": pads untouched for longer than the configured window are flagged
``cold_storage_eligible = True`` so a future tier can relocate their bytes to
cheaper storage. Nothing is destroyed and no "expiring soon" messaging is shown.

Mechanism (the boring option): the core ``flag_cold_pads()`` is a plain async
function. It can be driven two ways, both documented in DECISIONS.md:
  - as a cron entry point: ``python -m app.services.coldstorage``
  - as an in-process daily loop started from the app lifespan (no extra
    dependency — just an asyncio task), convenient for single-node deploys.
