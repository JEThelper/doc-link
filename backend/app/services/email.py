"""Transactional email delivery. Phase 7.

Delivery path is selected by ``settings.email_provider``:

  - ``""`` (default): console/log stub — the message + action link are written to
    the application log so flows are exercisable end-to-end in dev WITHOUT
    silently dropping mail. Only appropriate for dev/test.
  - ``"smtp"``: a real send over SMTP (``EMAIL_SMTP_*`` settings). SMTP is
    vendor-neutral — Postmark / SES / Mailgun all expose an SMTP endpoint — so
    there is no SDK lock-in. See DECISIONS.md (AUDIT B6).

NOTE on reachability: in the Supabase production deployment, gotrue sends all
transactional mail (password recovery, email verification) directly — every auth
route returns via the Supabase branch before reaching ``send_email``. This module
is the delivery path for the *legacy* (non-Supabase) auth flow only: the test
harness and any self-hosted deployment without Supabase configured. It is wired to
send for real (not a stub) whenever ``EMAIL_PROVIDER`` is set, which closes the
"silently never delivers" gap the audit flagged.
